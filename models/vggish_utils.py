  it's better to use a raised cosine that ends just before the final

  The classic HTK algorithm exploits the complementarity of adjacent mel bands
  to multiply each FFT bin by only one mel weight, then add it, with positive
  and negative signs, to the two adjacent mel bands to which that bin
  contributes.  Here, by expressing this operation as a matrix multiply, we go
  from num_fft multiplies per frame (plus around 2*num_fft adds) to around
  num_fft^2 multiplies and adds.  However, because these are all presumably
  accomplished in a single call to np.dot(), it's not clear which approach is
  faster in Python.  The matrix multiplication has the attraction of being more
  general and flexible, and much easier to read.

    audio_sample_rate: Samples per second of the audio at the input to the
